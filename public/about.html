<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Crystal. I am a current web developer. I am a wife and mother, which I enjoy, as well as a part time employee and a student. My daily life can be a bit crazy at times, but I make it all work.</p>

<p>I have always been fasinated by technology and how it works. So in 2020 I started my education in coding. Over the years my passion grew. I enjoy solving the mysteries of creating the best websites for my clients by taking their ideas and mixing them with some of mine. </p>
